The CAD files were divided into two main files: a complete SketchUp file with all the elements of the PPP Robot, and an STL file. There are also two links to view the final robot design: one to SketchUp Online and the other to a web-based robot simulator.

The SketchUp file shows the dimensions and general assembly. The simulator is a 1:1 replica of the prototype we developed, displaying the main movement functions, the camera's field of view (FOV), the positions the camera can reach, and the available workspace for mounting the components.
